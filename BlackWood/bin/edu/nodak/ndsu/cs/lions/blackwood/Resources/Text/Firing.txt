 Firing Employees can be the hardest task

"Severance", "Job Release", "Termination": these are some way we call firing.

Here are some list of questions we need to look at for the firing of an employee at Blackwood:

1: Does the employee have an oral or written contract of employment?

2: Does the employee's personnel file adequetly document the problem?

3: Did the employee commit an act that the workforce commission would consider "Misconduct" ?

4: Did the employee have fair notice that his or her conduct was unacceptable and an opertunity to correct the situation?

5: Is the employee over 40 and is the employee being replaced by someone substantially younger than the employee? This not from the past but a future law

6: Is the employee disabled in any way, including physical or mental handicaps?

7: Has the employee been injured on the job and/or filed a workers compensation claim?

8: Is this a present sexual harassment situation or have there been claims of sexual harassment involving this employees past?

9: Is the employee a minority with any possible claim of discrimination?

10: Is the employee female with any possible claim of discimination?

11: Is the employee titled to claim any kind of religion, national origin, ethnicity or status as a member of the armed forces?

12: Has the employee blown the whistle on any kind of alleged illegal activity or the employeer?

13: Is there a problem with the organization rather than the employee?

14: Is the employee being treated fairly?

Once we determine the action of the employee we need to look at firing the individual, these are the corporate principles for the Blackwood business.

Instructions for firing at Blackwood:

(On the home page of BLACKWOOD we need to go to the button of hiring and firing. Once the button is click we need to determine the course of the individual we are either hiring them or firing them. When the Firing button is clicked we need to remove the individual from the game. Because each store is allowed only one employee, hiring a new employee is the same as firing the old employee. An existing employee is automatically fired whan a new employee is hired.)
