Communicating in Blackwood

Talking to Players: Talking to other players during the game is an easy, fun way to interact while playing Blackwood. To do this, just click in the text box located in the middle of the screen, type your message, and everyone in the room will be able to read it in a speech balloon. This is sometimes useful when asking others how the shoppers are acting, and what they are buying the most of. Also, it is an easy way to let others know that you are logged on, so they can come to your store and interact with you.

Talking to Agents: While playing the game, every so often an agent will enter your store and ask you how things are going. An agent includes a character. A window will pop up and you may respond with a variety of different answers. One such response would be to report a crime in your neighborhood. There are many different ways to respond to these agents, which you will occasionally see while playing Blackwood.
